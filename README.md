# VisionVault – AI-Powered Face Blurring with Cryptographic Access  

## 📌 Overview  
VisionVault is an advanced computer vision application that automatically blurs faces in videos to help individuals with scopophobia while allowing authorized users to unblur them using a secure cryptographic key. This system ensures privacy, security, and controlled access to sensitive visual content, making it ideal for personal safety, surveillance, and content moderation.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
✅ **Real-Time Face Blurring** – AI-powered face detection for instant, seamless blurring.  
✅ **Adjustable Blur Intensity** – Users can modify the blur level based on preference.  
✅ **Selective & Context-Aware Blurring** – Choose specific faces or apply smart scene-based blurring.  
✅ **Hierarchical Access Control** – Role-based permissions allow different access levels (e.g., managers vs. public users).  
✅ **Cryptographic Blurring & Reversible Encryption** – Secure facial encryption, allowing only authorized users to decrypt and view unblurred faces.  
✅ **Crowd Density Detection** – Automatically adjusts blurring based on the number of faces detected.  
✅ **Scalability & Integration** – Cloud-based or edge-computing deployment with API support for third-party applications.
