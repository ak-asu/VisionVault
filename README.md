# VisionVault – AI-Powered Face Blurring with Cryptographic Access  

## 📌 Overview  
VisionVault is an advanced computer vision application that automatically blurs faces in videos to help individuals with scopophobia while allowing authorized users to unblur them using a secure cryptographic key. This system ensures privacy, security, and controlled access to sensitive visual content, making it ideal for personal safety, surveillance, and content moderation.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
✅ **Real-Time Face Blurring** – AI-powered face detection for instant, seamless blurring.  
✅ **Adjustable Blur Intensity** – Users can modify the blur level based on preference.  
✅ **Selective & Context-Aware Blurring** – Choose specific faces or apply smart scene-based blurring.  
✅ **Hierarchical Access Control** – Role-based permissions allow different access levels (e.g., managers vs. public users).  
✅ **Cryptographic Blurring & Reversible Encryption** – Secure facial encryption, allowing only authorized users to decrypt and view unblurred faces.  
✅ **Crowd Density Detection** – Automatically adjusts blurring based on the number of faces detected.  
✅ **Scalability & Integration** – Cloud-based or edge-computing deployment with API support for third-party applications.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **AI/ML Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for face detection  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, Dlib  
- **Cryptography**: AES-based reversible blurring  
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- **Deployment**: Cloud (AWS, Azure) or Edge Devices  

## 📂 Project Structure  




## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- RetinaFace (`retinaface`)

You can install them using:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy retinaface
```

## Usage
1. Place your video file in the working directory.
2. Ensure you have an encryption key file (`encryption_key.npy`), or modify the script accordingly.
3. Run the script with:
   ```sh
   python process_video.py
   ```

## Code Breakdown
- **Loading Encryption Key**: The script attempts to load an encryption key from a `.npy` file.
- **Reading the Video**: It opens the given video file and extracts frame properties such as width, height, and frames per second (FPS).
- **Face Detection**: Using RetinaFace, faces in each frame are detected, and bounding boxes and landmarks are drawn.
- **Saving the Processed Video**: The annotated frames are written to a new video file named `processed_video.mp4`.

## Output
The processed video with face annotations is saved as `processed_video.mp4` in the working directory.

## Example
To run the script on a sample video:
```sh
python process_video.py 855565-hd_1920_1080_24fps.mp4 encryption_key.npy
```

## Notes
- The encryption key functionality is currently a placeholder and does not encrypt/decrypt the video.
- RetinaFace detects faces in RGB format, so frames are converted before processing.
- The script assumes valid input files; ensure the paths are correct.
